                    <p>
                        Yes, any foreigner may obtain ownership of property in the interior of Mexico, they just need a permit from Foreigner Affair's Office. However, under Mexican law, foreigners cannot own direct property within the restricted zone (please read the next section to learn how to acquire property within the restricted zone).

                        The Restricted Zone in Mexico (known in the past as the "Prohibited Zone") is set up as such in the Mexican Federal Constitution. It is the land area within 100-kilometers of Mexico's international land borders (US, Belize and Guatemala) and the land area within 50-kilometers of Mexico's ocean front areas (the coast lines of Mexico).
                    </p>
                    <p>In the Restricted Zone foreigners can not own direct title to real estate located therein. They can however hold the title thereto via the long term bank title transfer trust or via a Mexican Business Corporation (depending upon the use of the property).</p>

                    <p>
                        In the trust, the Mexican fiduciary bank holds the title for the foreigners and performs all acts considered real rights, per the instructions of the beneficiary of the trust (the foreigner). The beneficiary of the trust can exercise the personal rights regarding the trust and the property placed therein. In other words the Foreigner has the rights to lease it, rent it, sell it, will it, etc... The cost for initiating a fideicomiso is around US$2800.00 and there is also an annual fee to the bank for maintaining the fideicomiso. The annual fee is based upon a percentage of the value of the home.
                    </p>
                    <p>If the property in question is for Residential purpose, then the mentioned trust is the only way to hold title. In the case that the property in question is for commercial use, then the foreigner can either hold the title to the property in a Trust or through a Mexican Business Corporation, to which he can hold ownership (limitations apply).</p>

                    <p>
                        The first step is a permit from the Foreigner Affairs office in which you register the name of your Mexican corporation. Three possible names for the company are submitted and a computer search for those names to avoid duplicating an existing name. The corporation requires a minimum of two live, individual share holders, that are at least 18-years of age. If the principal officer of the corporation is not mexican, will be require to have an FM-3 Visa (please read the next section).
                    </p>
                    <p>The next step is developing the articles of incorporation and this task requires the inclusion of a "Notario". Notarios are quite different than Notaries in other countries. The name is similar, however, the Notario in Mexico has incredibly vaster powers. The Notario is a keeper of the public record, a licensed attorney who passes the notario exam and is appointed by the state to represent it. Once the articles of incorporation are recorded in the public record, then it is time to obtain the necessary permits with other entities such as the Tax Department, Immigration, etc... All of the permit fees and the Notario's fee are around US$2,500</p>

                    <p class="large"><b>GETTING FINANCING.</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Purchasing a property in Mexico is an exciting decision, and with the growing and increasingly successful cross-border mortgage industry that has been developing in Mexico over the past few years, there are now more options than ever to finance your home!
                    </p>
                    <p>Mexico has historically been a cash-based economy, but with the influx of investment by foreigners, financing has become a viable alternative. Many US lenders and banks have turned to the Mexican market, and their previous US experience makes the process more familiar than if one were to finance directly through a Mexican bank.</p>
                    <p>For some people, the introduction of financing into the Mexican real estate market represents the opportunity to pursue a dream that may not have otherwise been tangible. Financing in Mexico is currently available for Americans and Canadians, with USDollar loan programs and UK citizens and Spaniards with Euro-based loan programs. Purchase, non-cash out re-finance (better rate and term), cash-out refinance, and residential construction loans are available, and there are many methods used for qualifying. Commercial loans are also available for construction and existing properties.</p>
                    <p>It is smart to finance through a broker, rather than directly through a lender, because you have access to more options through many lenders, thus enabling you to truly find the program that is best for you. Also, a broker retains copies of all of your documentation, which makes it much easier to alter the direction of the loan if necessary – a lender does not return your documentation to you, thus requiring you to recollect everything should you choose to change lending institutions service providers.</p>
                    <p>Due to the downturn in the US housing market, current troubles in the US market, many mortgage brokers are beginning to turn to the Mexican market. Loan experience in the US or Canada is certainly valuable, but because the Mexican process is different in many ways, it is important for you, as a borrower, to be sure you choose a broker that is experienced in Mexico. The best way to ensure this is to ask the loan officer or broker how many loans they have closed in Mexico and to request contact information for references. Many brokers can open your loan and take it to a certain point, but then it dies; this is why it is important to inquire about the number of loans a broker has closed because this gives you a much better idea of the quality of their work. Also inquire about application fees and origination fees. Application fees should be no more than between $200 and $300.</p>

                    <p>
                        Like many industrialized nations, Mexico has a comprehensive legal and statutory Immigration Policy affecting Mexicans and foreign nationals.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>FMT or Tourist Visa. </b> Tourist visas are intended for visitors to Mexico on short term visits (six months or less); usually tourists and short-term visitors. For trips of longer than six months, other visa should be considered. The FMT has a 'Business Visitor' section, specifically for persons who come to Mexico for short business visits not exceeding thirty days. FMT visas are issued by airlines and are also available at ports of entry.</p>
                    <p><b>FM3 (The Long-Term Non-Immigrant Visa).</b> Mexico operates what is known as a FM3 Visa. The FM3 visa is a renewable long term (more than six months) permit which gives non-immigrant temporary residency status to the holder. This means that it gives a person the right to live in Mexico (under terms as set out in the visa) but it does not lead to, and cannot be converted to, a visa leading to permanent residency.</p>
                    <p>There are various categories under which FM3 visas are granted, and these relate to the activities you intend to undertake while in Mexico. Under the terms of the FM3, you are authorized to only undertake certain, specific activities which may be lucrative or non-lucrative, depending on the visa's classification.</p>
                    <p><b>FM2 (The Immigrant Visa).</b> These visas are intended for people seeking permanent residency status in Mexico or those seeking eventual Mexican Citizenship.</p>
                    <p>There are various categories under which FM2 visas are granted, and these relate to the activities you intend to undertake while in Mexico. Under the terms of the FM2, you are authorized to only undertake certain, specific activities which may be lucrative or non-lucrative.</p>
                    <p>You must hold a FM2 for a qualifying period before you may apply for "immigrant" status or Mexican Citizenship. You do not need to have held a FM3 visa before applying for a FM2, and any years you may have accrued while living in Mexico under the auspice of a FM3 permit do not count towards your FM2 qualification period.</p>
                    <p>If your goal is to get the long term residency in Mexico or to become a Mexican Citizen, you should apply for FM2 Visa (or request a change of status from FM3 to FM2) so that your time starts counting towards the qualification period as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>
                        This is a VERY secure way to buy; it involves not one but three thorough title inspections, first by your "notario" (read Real Estate Attorney) then by Scotiabank Inverlat's legal department and thirdly in Mexico City by the Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores before they will grant a permit number for your trust.  All this takes about 4 weeks.  There is some confusion, a mis-understanding that this is some kind of lease.  It is not!  You own the property, but the Mexican Constitution demands that any property within 100 km of any border or 50 km of the coast must have the title held in trust.  Succession is particularly secure - your beneficiary is named in the trust, and there is no probate requirement in the case of your death.  You can rent, remodel, sell, bequeath, do anything you wish with the property - it is yours in every sense.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the initial term, the trust is set up for 50 years.  At the end of this time, should you or your heirs still own the property, you simply pay for an additional 50 year extension.  After 100 years... well, I haven’t gotten there yet, but the property is still yours.  If at that time the legal requirement is the same, you would set up a new trust, or it might be possible to simply extend the existing one for an additional period.</p>

                    <p>
                        In general ,this is not the best way to go.  If you are buying the house to be your home here, you should choose the fideicomiso which will allow you an exemption from capital gains tax when you sell, and which is also the correct legal process. In fact, setting up a corporation just to buy a house and avoid the fideicomiso is illegal. You will not save money overall, as you will have to employ an accountant to file monthly estimated taxes and to perform other legal functions for the corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if your purpose is to invest in buying, remodeling and selling a number of properties, it might be the appropriate option. You should talk with an attorney and accountant before deciding whether a corporation or a trust best fits your intentions.</p>

                        There are several ways to do this legally. If you are lucky enough to be employed by a company in Mexico, they will help you apply for a working visa.

                    <p>The more usual option, as there is little work available and it generally pays poorly, is to start your own business doing almost anything you would like to do.

You should have some qualifications in the field, but Mexico presents many opportunities for those with an entrepreneurial bent. </p>

                        We are in the tropics, and hurricanes can happen.  That said, they move from east to west and if they touch the Peninsula, they are much more likely to hit the Caribbean coast after which they typically lose intensity and veer off to the North.

                    <p>Our construction here, with solid cement roofs and walls with ceramic tile floors means that actual property damage is minimal – perhaps some water or a tree or two down, a few days without electricity. Insurance, again, is inexpensive and easily available.  Yucatan, in turn, has no tornados, volcanoes and no earthquakes.

                    <p>
                        Although we saw more than 15% a year appreciation from the time I founded Tierra Yucatan in 2001 until 2009, prices have leveled off over the following three years, making it much more difficult to "flip" a newly remodeled property.  The cost of an old Colonial-style house, more than 100 years old and built of solid rock, with 18 foot ceilings and mahogany doors is still reasonable - and much less than in other parts of Mexico.  surplus inventory since then has been absorbed, and prices are rising, both for remodeled and unremodeled homes. Although the price per meter has been escalating rapidly, we are still a bargain compared to other similar areas., there is no unrest whatsoever in Yucatan, and overall, I see no signs of a downturn in the Mexican economy or any type of insecurity in investing here.  People are moving in droves from central Mexico to Yucatan; I have put my money where my mouth is, and every time I have a little spare cash I buy another house.
                    </p>
                    <p>Renovation costs are still  reasonable, as wages are relatively low.  A bricklayer receives about $15 dollars a day in Merida for a hard day's work.  I too love remodeling old houses and have now done five.   We will try to recommend a list of architects, engineers or builders for you to interview., but the decision must be yours!</p>

Your profit, of course, will depend on how well you choose your house and the project. Whereas some years ago one could easily double one's money, now you have to be satisfied with a much smaller return, as costs of basic property, materials and labor are all rising. </p>
                    <p>If you hold a temprorary or permanent residence visa for Mexico and own your home in a fideicomiso,you can escape Mexican capital gains completely oralnost completely on the sale of one residence in any tree year period.</p>

                        In the past, this has been a problem and most of our transactions continue to be in cash. I would recommend looking for an owner willing to finance if you need it.

                    <p>
                        We have satellite TV available even in the most remote areas and cable in major cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>High speed internet is almost everywhere, There is free wireless internet in most Merida parks.</p>
                    <p>We have both 110 and 220 volt electricity, and service is as reliable as in the US. You can plug in your US appliances without any adapter.</p>
                    <p>In most areas,(not always if you are a long way out on the beach)  there is city water and many homes also have a well for irrigation, filling the pool etc.  All of Yucatan is on private septic tanks. Most people buy 5 gallon bottled water for drinking ($1.20 a bottle).  At minimal expense, if you desire, a plumber can install a water purifier in your kitchen and you can drink from the tap.</p>

                    <p>
                        Homes older than 30 years or so are generally built of solid limestone rock and mortar with cement roofs.  Newer construction is of cement block with cement roof - very solid! Most floors are ceramic tile – cool and easy to clean.  Finish materials often include local hand-cut stone and local hardwoods – mahogany and Spanish cedar.

                        It is no problem to bring in your pet.  You need a valid rabies certificate and another certificate from your vet dated within 10 days of travel to say your animal is healthy. You should check with your airline for special requirements and cost, as there is a lot of variation.

                        Our company will be glad to assist with rentals. You should not expect much more than enough to cover the day to day holding expenses of the property, as rentals are unpredictable.  Your main investment value is in appreciation of the property over time, provided it is properly maintained.

                        Yes; as a tourist you can get a permit at the border - there will be a deposit required which can be paid with a credit card.  With a non-resident visa, you can bring in a vehicle.  Only you or your immediate family may drive it and you cannot sell it in Mexico.  If you don't keep your residence visa renewed, you must remove the car from the country. You can get insurance for your vehicle here in Mexico at reasonable cost - civil liability insurance is required on all foreign vehicles being driven in Mexico, and full coverage is a wise choice.

                        Mérida has state of the art medical care available for about 1/10th the US cost!  We hope eventually your Medicare can be used here, (not yet!)  Merida is a center for "medical tourism" for people from all over Latin America and other parts of Mexico... the US and Canada too.  Many doctors and dentists here are fluent in English and some have trained in the US. If you are taking an unusual specific medication, please check on its availablity in Mexico.

                    <p>
                        Yes; If you are under age 65 and have no serious pre-existing conditions, private insurance is very reasonably priced.  You can also sign up for Mexican Social Security (IMSS) medical insurance as a resident in the country, I believe whatever your age, which is quite inexpensive and gives good coverage.

                        Mérida is a cultural Mecca!  Great symphony, opera, dance, art galleries, and street music of every kind.  On Sunday, the center is closed to traffic and becomes purely pedestrian, with street food, artesanias, music and dancing.  Paseo Motejo, the most beautiful avenue, becomes a bicycle and walking route which Merida families and tourists alike get out and enjoy
